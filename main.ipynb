    "\n",
    "Clustering methods partition a dataset consisting of $m$ data points $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, into a small number of groups or \"clusters\" $\\mathcal{C}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathcal{C}_{k}$. Each cluster $\\mathcal{C}_{l}$ represents a subset of data points which are more similar to each other than to data points in another cluster. The precise meaning of two data points being \"similar\" depends on the application at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering methods do not require labeled data and can be applied to data points characterized solely by its features $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$. Therefore, clustering methods are an example of **unsupervised machine learning methods**. However, clustering methods are also used in combination (e.g., as a preprocessing step) with supervised learning methods such as regression or classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering methods are roughly divided into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hard clustering methods that assign each data point to exactly one cluster and \n",
    "* Soft clustering methods that assign each data point to several different clusters with varying degrees of belonging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard clustering can be interpreted as a special case of soft-clustering where the degrees of belonging are enforced to be either 0 (not belonging) or 1 (belongs). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will consider one popular method for hard clustering, the k-means algorithm, and one popular method for soft clustering based on a probabilistic Gaussian mixture model (GMM). These two methods use a notion of similarity that is tied to the Euclidean geometry of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also presents the DBSCAN algorithm, which is a hard clustering method that uses a non-Euclidean notion of similarity to cluster the data points. "
